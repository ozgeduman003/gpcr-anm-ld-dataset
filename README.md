# gpcr-anm-ld-dataset
This repository provides PyMOL session files, representative PDBs from the project: Family-wide dynamics, allostery and activation pathways of class A GPCR by Dynamic Ensembles

The dataset was created using Anisotropic Network Modelâ€“Langevin Dynamics (ANM-LD) simulations, applied to **25 Class A GPCR families** across five ligand-binding classes: aminergic, lipid, nucleotide, protein, and peptide.
